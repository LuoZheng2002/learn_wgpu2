different render job under different render pass.

game object has a renderable member 

sumbits render job

text is a ui object

resource cached includes: pipeline, render_pass, texture, 



we have renderables; renderables can be of different models.

mesh filter

we also have instances; instances must have the same model



transparent:

renderable can be composed of several instances of the same model (a render call)

instances must have the same model (vertex buffer), texture, ...

instances: model matrix, animation rig positions, ...

renderables can render immuatably
renderables can increment its instances

model file is a scene
